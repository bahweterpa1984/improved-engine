Ensure your Fidelity accounts are connected properly in Quicken. Begin by checking the account settings to confirm that the profile is linked to your Fidelity brokerage account. If you encounter any issues, such as accounts showing "disconnected" or "offline," verify that your login credentials are correct.

If you see that accounts are "missing" or "pending," consider following these steps to integrate them into Quicken. First, refresh your connection by clicking on the update option. This action often resolves any temporary issues with online services.

If you are experiencing trouble displaying your current transactions, check whether the Quicken version you are using supports the Fidelity service you are trying to connect.

Regularly monitor your accounts by logging into both your Quicken and Fidelity profiles. This practice helps to ensure that any changes on the Fidelity web platform are reflected in your Quicken accounts. If you find transactions not updating, re-initiate the connection to bring your financial information up-to-date.

Stay informed about any service disruptions on Fidelity’s end that could affect connectivity. Check for alerts on the Fidelity website indicating whether maintenance is underway or if there are any known issues. Keeping track of these details allows you to manage expectations regarding missing data in Quicken.

Finally, utilize the "Simplifi" feature if available. This tool can help in summarizing financial data, making it easier to manage multiple accounts efficiently, all while ensuring that you are connected to the right online services.
